2D mask of a Drosophila class IV ddaC sensory neuron imaged
directly through the body wall of a late third instar larva (L3)
expressing mCD8::GFP under the control of ppk1.9-GAL4.

This binary image (downsized by 40%) was obtained from a
maximum intensity projection that was smoothed, thresholded
and from which the cell axon was manually removed.

The original 1.1um z-step stack was acquired in 2010 at the
McGill University Centre for Research in Neuroscience with a
Nipkow spinning disk confocal microscope (Yokogawa system
mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U equipped with a
Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera) using a 20x .45 NA lens.
